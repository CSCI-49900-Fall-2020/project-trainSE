# Open reSource Final Written Report

## Abstract

## Introduction

Whether it be contributing to an academic discussion or simply learning something new, everyone begins with a resource that supplies them with necessary background information. Finding that resource, however, is an arduous feat. Imagine navigating the maze of the Dewey Decimal System or tediously flip through thousands of pages in an encyclopedia without a guarantee that useful information will ever be found. Thankfully, the advent of the internet has revolutionized the way material is organized and shared, especially in academia.

Computer Science proves to be one of the most challenging majors offered by universities due to its abstract foundations and breadth/depth. But on the other side of the coin, it is also revered as the most open source discipline of study because of the tech community’s active collaboration and willingness to exchange knowledge. Just perform a tech-related search request on Google and your webpage is teeming with relevant links, videos, articles, and images. Yet, the aforementioned tedious page flipping is still evident in how one must perform a trial and error to find what they're actually looking for on the webpage. The first search result is sometimes a dense resource bogged down by jargon and complex phrasing that intimidates beginners. This issue worsens in the tech community where merely learning a new framework can be overwhelming due to extraneous tutorials that all teach the same thing. There lacks a platform that stores and moderates effective Computer Science resources and appeals to all experience levels.

Open reSource is a web app that would streamline how a techie moderates their self-learning by only presenting the best learning materials that other techie’s have found tremendously helpful.  The app’s name is a play on words with the open source community, but instead of collaborating on code, the tech community unites to approve the resources. We hypothesize that Open reSource can drastically reduce the research time of finding useful material, thus prioritizing one’s time to start learning instead of playing with process of elimination.

### Problem Recap
Open reSource provides the tech community a means to share and post effective CS resources they’ve stumbled upon during their research. Instead of allowing another programmer to excavate the depths of the Internet to find that hidden gem, a user can easily log onto Open reSource and post material they found extremely helpful to help reduce the research time for other programmers. A user can also explore the newest resources the tech community has collected and quickly begin their learning. Thus, a community is fostered and there is higher accountability for resources to be top tier, digestible, and easily accessible.
